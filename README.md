# How to run notebook

## Easiest Version with HTML
- Download the html file from github
- View notebook contents in the browser or click the "Edit or run this notebook" button in the upper right corner and follow instructions.

## Harder Version installing julia manually
Once julia-1.6 is installed you can run the notebook as follows
- Open a julia REPL 
- Inside the REPL
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Pluto")
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```
- Enter the path to the notebook file you've cloned (either randomsampling.jl or materials_modeling_presentation.jl)

## Follow Along With Presentation
There's a google slides presentation available at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J7uZkl6OfSF7nLd7CWlW9LnSiSk1b4theB0rVB3n8Yw/edit?usp=sharing
